                Machine learning engineers specialize in designing, developing, and implementing machine learning models and systems. They work with data scientists to transform research prototypes into production-ready systems. Machine learning engineers optimize models
                for performance, scalability, and efficiency, considering factors such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model deployment. Their work contributes to the development of intelligent systems that can make automated decisions
                and predictions.
